minValue	java.util.Date	Yes	the minimum value allowed for the Date value. When set to a fixed value on a tag, this will be parsed as an ISO 8601 date. ISO 8601 dates are of the form "yyyy-MM-dd" (for example: 2002-02-15) and the created Date object will be in the application's timezone, with the time components (hous, minutes, seconds, milliseconds) zeroed-out. All other uses require java.util.Date objects.When binding to Date objects, it is advised to create the Date object with zeroed-out values for any date-time components that aren't displayed (usually hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds) to allow the largest range of values to be accepted.
